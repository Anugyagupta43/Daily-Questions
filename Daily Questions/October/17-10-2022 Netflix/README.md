`A Cartesian tree with sequence S is a binary tree defined by the following two properties:`

`It is heap-ordered, so that each parent value is strictly less than that of its children.
An in-order traversal of the tree produces nodes with values that correspond exactly to S.
For example, given the sequence [3, 2, 6, 1, 9], the resulting Cartesian tree would be:`

`Given a sequence S, construct the corresponding Cartesian tree.`
